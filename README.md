Current CC3000 Service Pack: 1.12

This directory contains the master branch of
https://github.com/pabigot/cc3000, which holds the
[CC3000](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000) Host Driver
sources from Texas Instruments packaged into a git repository,
rearranged to avoid conflicts between CC3000 and application headers,
and augmented with an autoconf-based build infrastructure.  It
specifically supports building the library using
[mspgcc](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/).  It also contains
patches to some problems discovered when using the driver.

Source code is copyright Texas Instruments, released under BSD-3-Clause, and
available from the [download page of the CC3000
Wiki](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000_Wi-Fi_Downloads).
Modifications to the Texas Instruments code in this repository are intended
to be public domain.

This material is provided as a courtesy to interested developers, and is
not supported by me.  The discussion forum for the CC3000 SimpleLink
Wi-Fi capability is on [TI's E2E
forum](http://e2e.ti.com/support/low_power_rf/f/851.aspx).

Please note: I (pabigot) do not use any TI SPI drivers, and can't provide
support for using it independently or with TI example programs.  For basic
evaluation of the CC3000 I used the CC3000EM with a [driver for
BSP430](http://pabigot.github.com/bsp430/ex_rfem_cc3000.html).

Example of configuration and installation assuming mspgcc is installed:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/msp430-cc3000 --host=msp430
    make
    make install

To configure for TivaWare for C Series using GCC:

    ./configure --prefix=/prj/arm/tm4c \
      --host=arm-none-eabi \
      TARGET_CFLAGS='-mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 -mfloat-abi=softfp'

Versioning Information
----------------------

The version numbering policy for the CC3000 host driver is complex.
Some information about it is on the [CC3000
Wiki](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000_Release_Notes). Be
aware that service pack versioning is unrelated to application package
or host driver versioning, and cannot be identified at compile-time: it
may only be obtained from a powered module by using the
``nvmem_read_sp_version()`` API.

At this time the standard version identifier appears to be the Service Pack
version, which is currently 1.12.  For each Service Pack there is a
recommended version of the host driver application.  In this repository are
tags recording the exact contents of these TI source releases.

* swrc282 : TI CC3000 Host Driver extracted from CC3000 1.12 SDK on Windows

* swrc263c : TI CC3000 Host Driver release recommended for SP 1.11.1.

* swrc263b : TI CC3000 Host Driver release recommended for SP 1.11.

* swrc263a : TI CC3000 Host Driver release recommended for SP 1.10.
  This version was never directly integrated into the master branch.

Information on earlier releases present in the git repository can be found
in the corresponding README.TXT at each revision on the master branch.

Functional/API Changes from TI Release
--------------------------------------

The intent of the master branch of this repackaged version is to track
as closely as possible the TI release.  However, when there are bugs
that seriously impact its use, they will be fixed and the constant
``CC3000_REPACKAGED_VERSION`` that has been added to
``<cc3000/cc3000_common.h>`` updated.  This constant is a monotonically
non-decreasing integer literal such as 20140318.

For version 20140318, these upstream issues in SP 1.12 are fixed:

* Ability to use ``#include <time.h>`` and ``#include <sys/time.h>`` by
  not redefining required types when they are available from those files

* The implementation of ``ntohs/htons`` in ``<cc3000/socket.h>`` has
  been corrected to return a 16-bit rather than 32-bit value, to improve
  code portability.
